Database Schema Analysis:

The application uses localStorage to store data. The following tables and relationships can be inferred:

Tables:

1. serviceCoordinators:
    scId (string, primary key)
    firstName (string)
    lastName (string)
    phoneNumber (string)
    email (string)
    loginName (string, unique)
    loginPassword (string)
2. children:
    id (integer, primary key)
    firstName (string)
    lastName (string)
    nyeisId (string)
    dob (date)
    referralDate (date)
    initialIfspDate (date)
    status (string)
    coordinatorId (string, foreign key referencing serviceCoordinators.scId)
3. contacts:
    id (integer, primary key)
    childId (integer, foreign key referencing children.id)
    name (string)
    phoneNumber (string)
    address (string)
    email (string)
    mobilePhone (string)
4. authorizations:
    id (integer, integer, primary key)
    childId (integer, foreign key referencing children.id)
    authorizationId (string)
    type (string)
    startDate (date)
    endDate (date)
    unitsApproved (integer)
    status (string)
5. notes:
    id (integer, primary key)
    childId (integer, foreign key referencing children.id)
    authorizationId (string, foreign key referencing authorizations.authorizationId)
    date (date)
    startTime (time)
    endTime (time)
    note (string)
    category (string)
    qaCategory (string)
    eSignature (string)

Relationships:

One-to-many: serviceCoordinators to children (one service coordinator can have many children)
One-to-many: children to contacts (one child can have many contacts)
One-to-many: children to authorizations (one child can have many authorizations)
One-to-many: children to notes (one child can have many notes)
One-to-many: authorizations to notes (one authorization can have many notes)

Verification:

For every note entity, there exists exactly one associated child entity and exactly one associated authorization entity. This is ensured by the `showNoteFormInline` function, which requires the selection of a child and an authorization when creating or editing a note.
